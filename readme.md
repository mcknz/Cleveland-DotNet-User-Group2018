## Cleveland C#/VB.Net User Group
The Cleveland C#/VB.Net User Group is a non-profit, volunteer based organization aimed at helping all levels of computer users, ranging from hobbyists to consultants. The objective of the group is to provide a forum for sharing information and networking with those who work with C# and Visual Basic.Net. They invite programming professionals, as well as hobbyists, to join us the 4th week of each month. https://www.meetup.com/Cleveland-C-VB-Net-User-Group/

## Unraveling Realities: Building HoloLens Apps With Unity & C#
Confused by realities virtual, augmented, and mixed? As we discuss what these mean, you’ll learn how to build a personal reality for HoloLens. You don’t even need a device to get started — create an experience with Unity 3D, enhance it with C#, and deploy to the HoloLens emulator in Visual Studio.
